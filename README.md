# Music Genre Classification Using Discriminative ML Algorithms

## Overview

This repository is the home of the music genre classification project developed by Mayank Hirani, Farzan Mirza, and Enzo Saba for the CS4824/ECE5424 Machine Learning course. The aim of this project is to leverage various discriminative machine learning algorithms to accurately classify music tracks into genres based on audio features.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a Python application capable of classifying 30-second music tracks into their respective genres. To facilitate user interaction, a graphical user interface (GUI) is provided, allowing users to select among different models, compare their performance, and visualize the results in an accessible format.

## Methods Used

### Data Collection

The dataset consists of 10 music genres, each represented by 100 tracks. The features extracted from these tracks provide the basis for differentiating between genres.

### Machine Learning Models

Several machine learning models were explored:
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks (NN)

### Evaluation Strategy

Model performance is evaluated through cross-validation and feature selection techniques. The GUI displays meaningful figures to compare the efficacy of the various models.

## Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib

## Project Description

The 'MusicGenreClassifiers' project is an exploration into the application of machine learning for classifying music by genre. Through rigorous testing and evaluation, we aim to demonstrate the capability of discriminative models in understanding and categorizing music based on its intrinsic features. The project's GUI enhances the user experience by offering interactive elements to engage with the models' outcomes actively.

## Methodology

Our approach is methodical and user-centric:
1. The dataset is prepared by extracting significant audio features.
2. Various machine learning models are trained and fine-tuned on the dataset.
3. A GUI is provided for users to interact with the models and visualize results.
4. Performance metrics are computed and presented for each model.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
3. Run the main application to train/test models and use the GUI for interaction.
